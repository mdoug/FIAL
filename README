FIAL is a language, implemented in C, for the purpose of using by an
embedding C application through a C api.

The goals of the language is to provide a scripting language that
imposes as few design constraints upon the embedding application as
possible, and which has as low of an overhead for making calls into
and out of to the embeded application as possible.

The main goal of the scripting language is to abstract over memory, so
that the programmer concerns himself only with the values of
variables, and not their location in computer memory.  It should, for
example, be impossible to segfault from within the language.  It does
not aim to provide much abstraction over flow control.

Additional goals are an easy to use C api, a language that is
enjoyable for programmers to program in, good dynamic typing, a
convenient collection of data structures, snappy enough performance.
