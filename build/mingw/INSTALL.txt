This file describes the compilation of FIAL using mingw.  

In general, as of now, everything appears to work.  However, having set up the
project to compile under msvc, I plan for that to become the primary windows
platform.  

That being said, there is no reason to take this out of the project, I will
simply add in the new source files as I go along.  If for some reason it breaks
and I don't have the time to fix it, at that point I will consider removing it.  

But, in general, there is nothing special that needs to be done.  Flex from the
msys distribution works, in addition to that python (only tested with version
3.3 on windows, but on BSD the same files work with 2.7) is required, also a
recent copy of byacc (one that include btyacc support) is required.
