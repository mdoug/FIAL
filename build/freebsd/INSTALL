Ok, brief warning:  I have no idea what I am doing.  If you don't know how to
look at a Makefile, and decide whether or not it makes any sense, this software
is not for you.  I.e., installer beware. 

--------------------
Dependencies:
--------------------

Building FIAL requires byacc, but not the byacc from the FreeBSD base, which
does not have the %location support of the byacc from:

http://invisible-island.net/byacc/byacc.html

That byacc needs to be configured with the --enable-btyacc option.  To avoid
conflict with the base system yacc, I recommend mangling the name, and then
inserting the mangled name into the FIAL Makefile.  The current mangled name is
byacc_2014_ted, after the year, and the initials of the name of the maintainer
given on the web page.  

This can be accomplished with the following configure command to byacc's
configure script:

---

sh configure  --enable-btyacc --program-suffix=_2014_ted
gmake install && gmake clean

---

Note, this is just a build dependancy, it can be removed after FIAL is built. 
 In the alternative, the install could be omitted, with the pathname of the 
byacc executable given in FIAL Makefile.

There are also build dependencies on python, and flex.  As far as as I know, 
the ones on a typical BSD install work -- they didn't present any difficulties. 

--------------------

FIAL Install

--------------------

FIAL uses a gnu makefile for installation.  Just edit the YACC variable to match
the mangled name you passed to the configure script above.  

Relevant targets are "all" (default), "install", and "clean".  There is no 
uninstall option, since I don't feel comfortable writing that without wiping 
anything by mistake.  To uninstall, simply delete the directory that contains 
the headers, the executable from the bin directory (default name is FIAL), 
and the library from the lib directory (defaults to libFIAL.a).
