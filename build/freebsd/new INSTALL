Ok, brief warning:  I have no idea what I am doing.  If you don't know how to
look at a Makefile, and decide whether or not it makes any sense, this software
is not for you.  I.e., installer beware. 

--------------------
Dependencies:
--------------------

Building FIAL requires byacc, but not the byacc from the FreeBSD base, which
does not have the %location support of the byacc from:

http://invisible-island.net/byacc/byacc.html

That byacc needs to be configured with the --enable-btyacc option.  To avoid
conflict with the base system yacc, I recommend mangling the name, and then
inserting the mangled name into the FIAL Makefile.  The current mangled name is
byacc_2014_ted, after the year, and the initials of the name of the maintainer
given on the web page.  

This can be accomplished with the following configure command to byacc's
configure script:

---
./configure  --enable-btyacc 
---

There are also build dependencies on python, and flex.  As far as as I know, the
ones on a typical BSD insall work -- they didn't present any difficulties.  

--------------------
FIAL Install
--------------------

FIAL uses a gnu makefile for installation.  Just edit the YACC variable to match
the mangled name you passed to the configure script above.  

Relevant targets are "all" (default), "install", "uninstall", and "clean"
