This document explains how to build FIAL for msvc.  

The process is analogous to building for other systems.  Microsoft's nmake
utility is used to drive the build, using the Makefile in this directory.  The
overall build steps remain the same as the general case -- a version of python
is required to create the automatically generated headers.  

Furthermore, the build process assumes a properly set up environment.  The
simplest way to achieve this environment is to use the batch file for a
developers environment provided by visual studio.  The simplest way, in turn, to
achieve this is by means of a batch file, I have included "run-nmake.bat" in
this directory as well.  The first line may have to be modified, in the event
that your Visual Studio install differs from mine.  

Nmake has shown itself capable of performing the modest duties required of it in
this build, and I currently have no plans to replace it with a Visual Studio
project.
